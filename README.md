## Movie Search App
### Introduction
Develop an application in react using free https://themoviedb.org api.
In this app I have implemented reusable components for fetching movies data , showing data.


- GET request using fetch with async/await :
This sends the same GET request from React using fetch, but this version uses an async function and the await javascript expression to wait for the promises to return

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
